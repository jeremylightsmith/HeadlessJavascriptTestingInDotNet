This is an example of headless testing of javascript in .net.  That's right unit tests for javascript without a browser!

So download it, run it, play with it and use this approach to make your javascript code better!

== How did we do it? ==

Shoulders of giants :).

headless js tests = Javascript.NET + Jasmine + Env.js
Javascript.NET = V8 in .net
Jasmine = BDD in javascript
Env.js = Browser environment emulated in javascript (we borrowed the version from therubyracer)
